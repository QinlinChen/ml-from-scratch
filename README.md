This is my implementations of machine learning algorithms.

Its hierarchy is similar to the scikit-learn.

Here are some algorithms that implemented:

```
mlfs --- cluster --- KMeans
      |           |- DBSCAN
      |           `- AgglomerativeClustering
      |
      |- mixture --- GaussianMixture
      |
      `- ensemble --- AdaBoostClassifer
                   `- RandomForestClassifer
```
